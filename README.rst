``browsercast``
===============

An IPython Notebook plugin which allows IPython Notebook notebooks to be set to
audio, creating a screencast-style presentation in the browser - a browser
cast.

**Status**: BrowserCast is under active development, and should work well
enough that you can use it to create useful presentations! It is currently
implemented as a bookmarklet instead of a "real" Notebook plugin, but that
will change soon. To give it a try, see: http://wolever.github.io/browsercast/

FAQ
---

| Q: What about recording audio in the browser too?
| A: Unfortunately the APIs aren't great at the moment, and Audacity is a very
     good tool for creating and editing audio.

| Q: Can people watching a browsercast interact with the IPython notebook?
| A: In theory they can, but there are some technical challenges that make it
     unlikely to be properly supported.
