``browsercast``
===============

An IPython Notebook plugin which allows IPython Notebook notebooks to be set to
audio, creating a screencast-style presentation in the browser - a browser cast.

**Status**: ``browsercast`` is currently a proof of concept, and not (yet) a
"real" Notebook plugin. For more, see: http://wolever.github.io/browsercast/

A quick demonstration, in the form of a screencast: http://youtu.be/CYxZq4rZw0c
