``browsercast``
===============

An IPython Notebook plugin which allows IPython Notebook notebooks to be set to
audio, creating a screencast-style presentation in the browser - a browser cast.

**Status**: ``browsercast`` is currently a proof of concept, and implemented as
a bookmarklet instead of a a "real" Notebook plugin. To give it a try, see:

A quick demonstration, in the form of a screencast: http://youtu.be/CYxZq4rZw0c

FAQ
---

| Q: What about recording audio in the browser too?
| A: Unfortunately the APIs aren't great at the moment, and Audacity is a very
     good tool for creating and editing audio.

| Q: Can people watching a browsercast interact with the IPython notebook?
| A: In theory they can, but there are some technical challenges that make it
     unlikely to be properly supported.
